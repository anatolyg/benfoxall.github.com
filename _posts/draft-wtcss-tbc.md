# tl;dr

You can see how css rules impact a page by visiting [this site][wtcss].  I'm hoping that it helps me find how I can write more semantic / modular / wonderful css.

* Why I built this

* What I hoped to see

* some examples & discussion:
	- google.com
		- A lot of the styled elements are offpage, guessing that this means that they can be brought onto the page more efficiently
		- Can be a bit of a bad example because it's so heavily optimised
		- Classnames are going to be generated/minified/optimised
	- bootstrap
		- 

* Implementation
	- phantomjs
	- injected script
		- having to re-insert cross domain stylesheets
	- ui
	- using phantomjs server

* Deployment
	- when I wrote this, didn't get off my local machine.
	- came to it a few months later when I saw heroku buildpacks
	- what is a buildpack
	- what I changed
		- store nothing architecture
		- used the embedded mongoose driver
